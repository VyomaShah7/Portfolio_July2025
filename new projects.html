								    <h3>SRM Games</h3>
								    <p><span class="image right"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c1uUPJIAF_d1mQ8sgsMskRrGWq1CwZM5/view?usp=sharing" class="image fit"><img src="images/SRMGames.PNG" alt="SRM Games" /></a></span>
										SRMGames is a prototype of Game that I have created with the idea of compiling all types of simple games as a subgame to a single game.</p>
								    <hr />
								    <p>Here, players can find different genres of game at the same destination and play whichever game they want to play. I have also made sure to make the game simpler so that a wide range of audience can enjoy playing it and enjoy playing video games. For now, three genres are implemented which are shooting game, riddle game and destructor game.</p>

									<h3>Castler Game</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bUNFyVhlf3qksc5MkuYDIszP6Z869lr7/view?usp=sharing" class="image fit"><img src="images/CastlerGameCreationShot.PNG" alt="Castler Game" /></a></span>
										Castler is a castle demolition game based on the demolition prototype referenced from the book. In this game the main objective is to demolish the castles and cross the levels to get to a new level. The levels here are not connected to each other so a player can play the levels in any order the player wants to play. Also, the shots taken to pass each level are noted on the screen and each level has two sections to pass the level.</p>
									<hr />
									<p>The game starts with a start screen then moves forward to a levels pane from which a level can be selected and after the level is passed the level completed screen is shown. To demolish the castles a slingshot mechanism is given which is made up of a catapult and a sphere. Here, the sphere is shot from the catapult and the sphere is hit on the castle to a point marked as goal and if the goal is hit then the castle breaks and gets demolished.</p>
									<hr />

									<h3>Cherry Scooper Game</h3>
								    <p><span class="image right"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UxJRMJgknkE1L_9lc3KnW0uBhIDGN8HX/view?usp=sharing" class="image fit"><img src="images/CherryScooperGame.PNG" alt="Cherry Scooper Game" /></a></span>
										CherryScooper is an ApplePicker prototype game. The game's main objective is to collect all the cherries falling from the given tree in the main scene in a basket and the cherry is destroyed or in a sense collected in the basket and this scores points. Through these score points we can also make sure to understand whether the game is able to make new scores and store it or not.</p>
								    <hr />
								    <p> There are a lot of components involved here like a cherry tree, cherries, baskets, highscore counter, a score counter and all the physics and mechanics that help in making the tree move and cherries drop and get collected. The tree is moving in the game as well as the baskets which is making the game have a bit of higher difficulty than the tree just being static there. The mechanics and real game dynamics are explained in further sections.</p>

									<h3>AI and ML based projects</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/GamestoSurvey.PNG" alt="" /></span>Images of the Survey Made.</p>
									<hr/>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/GamestoSurvey1.PNG" alt="" /></a></span>
										To understand why people play mobile games for long hours and how to give them personalized recommendations to start something new and simple rather than playing mobile games.</p>
									<hr />
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/GamestoSurvey2.PNG" alt="" /></span>Survey Taken: To generate a form which gets responses from people about whether they play games or not, how many hours they play games, what are their hobbies, what type of games they play and the reason they play games.
									</p>
									<hr/>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/GamestoSurvey3.PNG" alt="" /></span>In this procedure I have primarily used bar charts to understand the pattern of different features involved in the dataset and google form has produced bar charts based on data for the same purpose. I have also used python through jupyter notebook and its libraries(like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib) to get two different methods implemented first to get recommended activities and then to get personalized suggestions with descriptions.
										For recommending similar activities I have used TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to identify similar interests between different players. Through this code I got the answer as activities that matched the most with other players being suggested as top recommendations and based on that suggestion it also provides a description for how to approach the suggested skill in a simple and concise way. The code also provides the information on personalized recommendations for all the responders if needed.
